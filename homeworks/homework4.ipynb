Each record includes the property values of the house and attributes such as street type, year of construction, roof type, basement condition. The data includes multiple datatypes, including integers (year of construction), discrete labels (roof type), floating point numbers, etc.; Some data is missing and is thus labeled 'na'. The price of each house, namely the label, is only included in the training data set (it's a competition after all). The 'Data' tab on the competition tab has links to download the data.\n",

To check the variance we use $\\mathbf{E}[(x-\\mu)^2] = \\sigma^2$ and thus the transformed variable has unit variance. The reason for 'normalizing' the data is that it brings all features to the same order of magnitude. After all, we do not know *a priori* which features are likely to be relevant.

    "The k-fold cross-validation was introduced in the section where we discussed how to deal with [“Model Selection, Underfitting and Overfitting\"](underfit-overfit.md). We will put this to good use to select the model design and to adjust the hyperparameters. We first need a function that returns the i-th fold of the data in a k-fold cros-validation procedure. It proceeds by slicing out the i-th segment as validation data and returning the rest as training data. Note - this is not the most efficient way of handling data and we would use something much smarter if the amount of data was considerably larger. But this would obscure the function of the code considerably and we thus omit it."
